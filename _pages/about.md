Hi there! I am a mechanical engineer who thrives at the intersection of mechanics, electronics and software. 
In 2019, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and robotics. 
I'm currently working at PA consulting in San Francisco building all kinds of innovative things.

In my spare time I like to play the guitar, cook, and develop video games.

This website is still under construction. Stay tuned for more projects, sketches, and posts about what I'm currently working on and learning about!
